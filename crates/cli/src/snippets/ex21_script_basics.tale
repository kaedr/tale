// Scripts can be defined to create a set of repeatable actions.
// They can be used to group Table rolls that are commonly made together:
Script: Starting Gear
	Roll on Weapons
	Roll on Armor
	Roll on Accessories
	Roll on Wealth
End Script

// More generally, they are used to group a sequence of actions to be performed
// together, like clearing the modifiers from several tables all at once.

// To make use of a Script, you use the `Invoke` keyword
Invoke Starting Gear
